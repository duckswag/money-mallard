Money Mallard is a Discord bot created extremely quickly extremely poorly. This Bot doesn't even use Slash Commands or Servers, it just tracks messages and returns the info. It would be a **really** bad idea to use this as a template, but I've decided to show the source code. This is a Custom Python Bot made in Replit. Also, it only runs temporarily for around 10 or so hours per day with lots of breaks and pauses.


# PIPs

The PIP contents are not listed, so you have to install all of them separately.

# Weird Formatting

I made this code quickly without taking into consider the logic in it, so this may be hard to translate. Again, I have no idea why you would be reading this right now.

# Secrets

This uses [Replit's Secrets feature,](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/workspace-features/secrets) which may lead to problems with the bot if you dont add them itself. It should only be the Bot Token and Webhook that gets effected though.
