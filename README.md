# money-mallard

Money Mallard is a Discord bot created extremely quickley extremely poorly. This Bot doesn't even use Slash Commands or Servers, it just tracks messages and returns the info. It would be a **really** bad idea to use this as a template, but I've decided to show the source code. This is a Custom Python Bot made in Replit.
